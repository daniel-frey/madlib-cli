# 03 - Errors, Files, and Packaging

Creation of a command line MadLib type game

# Version
- 0.0.1

# Feature Tasks

- Keeping in mind the concept of Single Responsibility Principle, build a command line tool which will perform the following:
- Print a welcome message to the user, explaining the Madlib process and command line interactions
- Read a template Madlib file, and parse that file into usable parts.
- You need to decide what components of this file are useful, and how to break those useful pieces apart
- Write the completed template to a new file on your file system (in the repo).


# Running the Application

Once the repo is cloned and you are ready to go with the pipenv created, simply type "madlib.py" in your terminal window. Follow the onscreen instructions

# Testing

All tests are written in PyTest - To run the tests make sure that pipenv is running ("pipenv shell"), and then install pytest ("pipenv install pytest"). Once that is finished, you may run the tests by simply typing "pytest" in the terminal.
